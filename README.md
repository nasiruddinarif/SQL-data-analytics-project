## **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
After successfully building our **data warehouse**, the next step is to **explore our data**.  

### **Why is EDA Important?**  
When working on a **new role or project**, it's essential to **understand the data warehouse structure** and datasets. EDA helps answer questions such as:
- How many datasets do we have?
- How many columns exist in these datasets?
- What are the column features and constraints?

### **Step-by-Step EDA Process**  
1. Navigate to the **`scripts`** folder.
2. Open the **`Exploratory-Data-Steps`** folder.
3. Run the **SQL scripts (01 to 06)** to:
   - Identify **dimension and measure columns**.
   - Analyze **date ranges** within the datasets.
   - Explore **key measures** to understand their impact.
   - Perform **magnitude analysis** to assess data distribution.
   - Conduct **ranking analysis** to categorize performance levels.

By performing these steps, we can gain **a complete overview of the dataset** before diving into deeper analysis.

## **Analyzing Data to Extract Business Insights**  
Once we have **explored and understood** our datasets, the next step is to **analyze the data** to uncover **business insights**.

### **Step-by-Step Business Analysis**  
1. Stay in the **`scripts`** folder.
2. Open the **`Analyze-Data-For-Business-Steps`** folder.
3. Execute SQL scripts **01 to 07** in sequence to perform:
   
   - **Trend Analysis:** Examine how a **measure evolves over time** to detect trends and seasonality.
   - **Deep Dive Analysis:** Drill down further to identify **causes of fluctuations** and anomalies.
   - **Cumulative Analysis:** Calculate **running totals and moving averages** for key performance metrics.
   - **Part-to-Whole Analysis:** Understand **category contributions** to overall sales or revenue.
   - **Performance Analysis:** Evaluate **product, customer, and regional** performance over time.
   - **Ad-Hoc Analysis:** Segment customers to support **business strategy and decision-making**.
   - **Final Reporting:** Prepare a summary report on **customers and products** to provide actionable insights.

##Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive and structured SQL toolkit for data analysis. It's designed to guide users, especially data analysts and BI professionals, through a complete analytical workflow. The project begins with exploratory data analysis (EDA) to help users understand a new dataset's structure, features, and constraints. This foundational step is critical for ensuring the subsequent analysis is accurate and relevant.

After the initial exploration, the project shifts to advanced business analysis. It offers a series of SQL scripts for common analytical tasks like trend analysis, cumulative calculations, and segmentation. By following these steps, users can transform raw data into valuable business insights, such as identifying performance trends, understanding customer behavior, and preparing actionable reports. Ultimately, the project's goal is to empower users to efficiently and effectively extract meaningful insights from a relational database using a collection of pre-built, best-practice SQL queries.
